# Which courses should I take after Math 4MB3?

If you've taken [Math 4MB3](https://davidearn.github.io/math4mb/) and are wondering about what else to take, then

- you are presumably in your 3rd rather than 4th year

- you have presumably already taken [Math 3F03](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=139768), the prerequisite course on the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, as well its prerequisites (calculus and linear algebra)

All of the courses listed as options in the [Honours Biology and Mathematics programme](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=14172) are useful.  There are also some [graduate courses](https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/index.php/graduate-studies/graduate-courses.html) that you can obtain permission to take as an undergraduate.  How you prioritize the various courses depends to a large extent on your interests and what you're hoping to do after graduating.  However, one thing you should make sure you do before graduating is take at least one course in computer programming.

# Specific courses and why they are useful from the perspective of mathematical biology

## Courses by topic

### COMPUTER PROGRAMMING:

If you want a career involving mathematical thinking, it is almost certain that you will find yourself needing to program, and the more background you have the better off you'll be.  Any of these standard intro courses is a sensible place to start:

- [COMPSCI 1MD3](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=140460) - Introduction to Programming - [2017 course info](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~cs1md3/index.html)
- [MATH 1MP3](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=141886) - Introduction to Mathematical Scientific Computation - [2018 course info](https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/index.php/news/61-/level-1/1585-math-1mp3-winter-2018.html)
- [PHYSICS 2G03](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=141166) - Scientific Computing

If you've taken one of the above courses, you may be able to get permission to take one or more of these graduate courses:

- [Computational Science and Engineering Courses](https://computational.mcmaster.ca/graduate-studies/courses.html)
- [Stat 744](https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/index.php/news/60-/level-7/1697-stats-744-winterl-2018.html) - Special Topics in Statistics: Data Visualization - [2018 course info](http://bbolker.github.io/stat744/)

### DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

Models of biological systems are almost always expressed as some kind of [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), which really just means we are normally studying things that change in time.  The models can be [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system) or [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic) in [continuous or discrete time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time).  The more you know about [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), the more prepared you'll be to develop and apply mathematical models to biological problems.

#### Deterministic dynamical systems

- ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
    - 2C, 3F, 4FT
- partial differential equations (PDEs)
    - 3FF, 4FT
- difference equations (discrete time systems)
    - 3DC

#### Stochastic dynamical systems

- stochastic processes
    - [Stat 3U](https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/index.php/news/63-/level-3/1563-stats-3u03-winter-2018.html)

### ANALYSIS

- real analysis

- complex analysis

- numerical analysis

### ALGEBRA AND DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

- algebra

- combinatorics and graph theory

### STATISTICS

- stochastic processes

### BIOLOGY

- population ecology (BIO 3SS3)
- evolution

## GRADUATE COURSES IN OR RELATED TO MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY

- MATH 746 - Bifurcation Theory
