# Which courses should I take after Math 4MB3?

If you've taken [Math 4MB3](https://davidearn.github.io/math4mb/) and are wondering about what else to take, then

- you are presumably in your 3rd rather than 4th year

- you have presumably already taken [Math 3F03](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=139768), the prerequisite course on the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations

All of the courses listed as options in the [Honours Biology and Mathematics programme](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=14172) are useful.  There are also some [graduate courses](https://www.math.mcmaster.ca/index.php/graduate-studies/graduate-courses.html) that you can obtain permission to take as an undergraduate.  How you prioritize the various courses depends to a large extent on your interests and what you're hoping to do after graduating.  However, one thing you should make sure you do before graduating is take at least one course in computer programming.  If you want a career involving mathematical thinking, it is almost certain that you will find yourself needing to program, and the more background you have the better off you'll be.

## Specific courses and why they are useful from the perspective of mathematical biology

### Undergraduate courses

- calculus

- linear algebra

- ordinary differential equations

- partial differential equations

- real analysis

- complex analysis

- numerical analysis

- algebra

- statistics

- stochastic processes

### Graduate courses

- Math 747: Topics in Mathematical Biology

- Math 746: Bifurcation Theory

- Stat ???: Biostatistics

- Stat 744: Visualization

Here are some examples of paths you might be interested in following, and what courses are likely to be most relevant to you.
