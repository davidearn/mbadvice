# Which math courses should I take after Math 4MB3?

If you've taken [Math 4MB3](https://davidearn.github.io/math4mb/) and wondering about what else to take, then

- you are presumably in your 3rd rather than 4th year

- you have presumably already taken [Math 3F03](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=139768), the prerequisite course on the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations

All of the courses listed as options in the [Honours Biology and Mathematics programme](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=24&poid=14172) are useful.  How you prioritize them depends on your interests and what you're hoping to do after graduating.
